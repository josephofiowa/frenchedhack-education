But even with that fluency I realized that I had never lived as a full-fledged adult professional in France.  This meant that when I returned to France over the years and wanted to speak to my French friends about my work in the financial industry I lacked the French vocabulary and so did they because it wasn't their area of expertise.  Also there had been a digital revolution which I participated in in the United States since I'd been a junior in high school in France.  But that I lacked the French vocabulary to say download, digital, cellphone, broadband, etc.  Plus since I'd lived for an extended period with a host family who  gave me my monthly allowance I lacked the vocabulary in French to discuss lodging, finances, and utilities even though I was fully capable and compete in those areas in English.  The Teaching Assistantship afforded me the opportunity to become what I would call a full-fledged French professional.  Because of this opportunity I would feel comfortable and capable of working in any work environment in France or la Francophonie.  Then there was the teaching specific hands-on experience that was absolutely relevant to my current position as a classroom Teacher in a French Immersion school in Minnesota.

I also learned adaptability outside of the classroom- living in a new town with new people and in a language other than my native tongue is no small change, and I had to be patient with myself as I found the bus routes to get around town and which grocery store was the easiest to get to, etc.  All of it, though, was a delight, because during both of my years as a Teaching Assistant, I met so many people who were willing to help me out with anything and everything- from deciphering my insurance papers to lesson plan questions to simply going to get a café allongé after work... the kindness of the teachers, administration, fellow assistants, students, and citizens of my town in Bretagne was absolutely extraordinary, and I always felt at home there.

French proficiency is central to my current job in the US, as we have a French parent company that I communicate with on a daily basis.    On a personal level, teaching kids was a highly fulfilling job.  I also taught English in Japan, but much preferred my experience in France because assistants were given much more autonomy to develop their own lesson plans and even teach independently.    I also developed strong friendships with teaching assistants and teachers during the program. Some of them I'm still in contact with today, eight years later.      Since we had time off during school holidays, we had the opportunity to travel around France.  Also, our part-time hours allowed us to to take classes or do private tutoring on the side.    This program was truly life-changing.  I was extraordinarily fortunate to have an ideal combination of factors that made my first year the most memorable and enjoyable (pleasant co-workers, well-behaved students, other assistants in my town [not socially isolated], town had a TGV station and good bus service, comfortable and cheap FJT housing, lived near work).  Through this experience, I learned that quality of life and cost of living are important factors when considering English teaching jobs abroad. Although the French program is part-time and my total salary was lower compared to what I made teaching in Japan, the quality of life in France was far superior and the cost of living much lower.

(It even got me into Pompeii during a trip to Italy).    Professionally, the program lent insight into my strengths and weaknesses as an educator.  Prior to TAPIF, I had actually never worked with primary or secondary students; I hadn't even babysat before. Assigned to a middle and a vocational high school, it threw me in the middle of classrooms with students  ages 11 to 17-- without a supervisor.  Beyond teaching skills, what I loved about my year in France was gaining an insider's perspective into the country's the educational system -- to which I'm now applying for graduate programs -- and the way it seeks to promote French republican values.    Personally: The program taught me how to navigate French bureaucracy by myself, from immigration, to health care, to making friends in a foreign city.

Keep me informed about opportunities,"TAPIF was an incredible experience and opportunity for me. On a personal level, it was an important step in my growing independence. To move to a foreign country right out of college and see what I could do on my own was character-building and central to my future. Many do not have the opportunity to immerse themselves in a different country, a different culture. TAPIF provided this to me. It's difficult to put into words all of the benefits of being a teaching assistant for a year in France. Experiencing new customs, history, food. Making new friendships and connections that will last a lifetime. Working in a different country and teaching others, which in turn teaches you a great deal.     In terms of my professional path, I've spent the last several years in the documentary filmmaking/non-profit sector. I've worked on films and campaigns focused on a range of topics, from girls' education around the world to child sex trafficking and exploitation prevention to a street art activism and MS awareness. I found in job interviews that having lived in a different country and knowing more than one language was appealing to many employers. It shows you can expand your world, your knowledge. You're openminded. In one of the documentary campaigns I worked on, we filmed in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo where French is a primary language. You never know when knowing a second language such as French will be useful and pop up again in your life - personal and professional.

I loved being able to live in another country, work on my French language skills and experience French culture. I travelled extensively in Europe during my time as an Assistant, as well. This period of my life allowed me to grow and develop in a way that I never expected. Living in another culture allowed me to become aware of differences in how others live and what others value. It allowed me to both question and solidify my own values. It let me to see myself and the world through a lens different from the one I had grown up with. It was challenging, exciting and enriching.     After my assistantship, I went on to pursue my graduate studies in counseling psychology. I chose to attend an English-speaking university in Quebec, so that I could continue to use my French language skills. (The suggestion to consider this university actually came from a fellow language assistant!) Now, as a practicing psychologist in the province, I continue to use those language skills to serve French-speaking clientele, and to, of course, live my daily life in a bilingual community. In my work counseling immigrants and foreign exchange students in Quebec, I also notice that my own experiences in adapting to a foreign culture help me empathize with their daily challenges of navigating language and cultural intricacies.     I value my experience as a Teaching Assistant more than I can fully express here. I would encourage anyone considering this opportunity to take a chance and go for it!

I would never trade my experience in France for anything, I had an amazing time, got to meet loads of awesome people from all around the world, many of whom we still speak to and even see on a regular basis, and experience a beautiful country and people.

I had a difficult time learning French on the program as I was paid 900€ a month, 550 of which went to rent and then other maintenance 75€. So 275€ for food and entertainment- quite a small amount (I was 27 so I didn't quality for government assistance) Living off of so little left me few choices to hire tutors, and language tandems were very unreliable. Since I didn't have an EU passport I couldn't leagally make ends meet so I did university students' homework and tutored English for cash. I didn't get to experience the wine region or even travel in France. I didn't have money to try French cuisine at restaurants. So as a French teacher now, I feel a bit left behind on the cultural side this way. However I leaned slang and how to chat with random people.  I sort of felt they just threw us in a room. I'm a trained teacher and they didn't give us any curriculum. At the end they gave us a checklist of what they should have learned... Luckily I had covered a lot of it. The teachers and principals were too busy or not present to offer advice and didn't know much about the assistantship program. So I leaned how to teach better by getting thrown in the deepe end. Every challenge is an opportunity and I was following my passion. I loved France, the people and the culture despite it all.

Keep me informed about opportunities,"I decided to begin my post-collegiate personal and professional exploration as a Teaching Assistant in France. I entered into the job knowing, but only half believing, that I had most traits and skills needed for the classroom- practical knowledge, willingness to improvise, creativity, compassion, etc. However, even with previous teaching and leadership experience, I didn’t consider that my toughest obstacle would be my confidence. The first couple weeks, I was extremely anxious about my lesson plans, perfecting them every chance I had, continuously reviewing them until I had branded them in my mind. But after working with the wonderful English language teachers at Lycée Camille Sée and Collège Molière, I quickly felt supported, guided and engaged and my previous anxiety began lifting away. Once I gained confidence in the classroom, I started speaking French more freely, which thus helped me connect to my city and make lifelong friends, both within and external to the TAPIF community. After my time as a Teaching Assistant in France, I couldn’t shake the exhilaration I felt when introduced to new experiences and people. So, I decided to continue traveling, stopping first in Ireland, where I found an organic and sustainable farm to work on through the association ‘World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms’ (WWOOF). I then used my experience teaching English as a second language to teach English in Taiwan for a couple of months, followed by a bit more traveling in surrounding countries Vietnam and Thailand. Now, I’ve finally landed in Australia, where my yearlong visa allows me to travel and work simultaneously. The people I met and skills I learned during TAPIF have inspired and helped me to continue exploring other cultures and places.

I studied abroad for a semester during my junior year of college and loved the experience, but didn't know when I would be back. Upon graduating college, I knew I wanted to go to graduate school but did not know in what field of study. My then-boyfriend (now-husband) is Swedish, and when his student visa in the U.S. expired, I suggested that I apply for the Teaching Assistantship program and we move to France for a year. I was accepted and we moved to Lille that fall. Teaching English to elementary school children, I realized how much I enjoyed working with that age group. I was considering applying to speech therapy graduate school at the time, and my experience in France was vital to that decision. I took the GRE in London that December and applied to graduate schools in January. The topic of my personal statement was all about my experience thus far teaching English in France through the Assistantship program. I am now a certified speech language pathologist living in New York City. Although I do not use French language in my work, my understanding of French grammar, different speech sounds, and time spent in an elementary school continue to influence my career today.",YesNantes,,,,2002-2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Professors or Administrators at my University ,,,,,,,,,,,,Interest in French culture,Improve French language skills,,,"Desire to live in France, long-term",,,,,Oregon,Communications/Marketing,,Irrelevant - I never use French in my work,,Networking gatherings for TAPIF Alumni,,Opportunities to help new Assistants before their departure,,,,,Maybe.

I am interested in helping launch a TAPIF Alumni Chapter,"Taking part in TAPIF afforded me the chance to experience life abroad--a chance I wouldn't have thought possible (or even enjoyable) prior to college.  I had never been somewhere where ""y'all"" was not part of the vernacular.  However, I became fascinated with the French language and French culture, having minored in college.    I'd always been an independent person and, since my course of study and intended career were not French-centric, I figured the year after graduation from college could be my only opportunity to spend an appreciable amount of time abroad.  Living as a foreigner in a country with such a rich culture gave me an immensely expanded perspective on my own life and the lives of others.  I learned to become my own advocate and to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.  As evidence of personal growth that the experience afforded me, I must say that I had always considered myself a reserved person and had trouble speaking in front of just a few people in English or in French.  Being thrust in front of a classroom on the first day, even with the best laid of plans was terrifying for me.  Within a week, it was not only normal but enjoyable to be in front of a classroom full of students, sharing American culture and the English language.  Within a couple of months, I was asked to lead a forum at the high school where I worked with some of the other foreigners in town (the other assistants de langue, three members of the Service Volontaire Européen, and a few Rotary exchange students) on the topic of life abroad (""comment j'ai vécu mon arrivée à l'étranger"").  Mere months before, I would have declined even if I were allowed to speak my native language, but I was able and excited to moderate a panel on the topic in front of 200 French high schoolers, genuinely hoping to instill a desire to go abroad.    Although my current work and intended profession show little promise of using French on a regular basis, those characteristics engendered and strengthened by my experience as a teaching assistant have had a definitive impact in my personal and professional lives.",YesGuadeloupe,,,,,,,,,,,2009-2010,,,,,,,,Professors or Administrators at my University ,,,,,,,,,,,,Interest in French culture,Improve French language skills,,"Desire to live in France, short-term",,"Spend a gap year before graduate school, starting an internship, or working",,,,Massachusetts,Education - Primary/Secondary (K-12),,Somewhat Important - I sometimes use French in my work,Social gatherings for TAPIF Alumni,Networking gatherings for TAPIF Alumni,,,,Information about relevant employment opportunities,Connections to local French language and culture events,,Yes!  I am interested in participating if a Chapter near me is launched,"I ended up loving teaching ESL, and went to school to earn my masters in teaching ESL.

Given the frustrations that come with integrating into a new system, especially in a country that doesn't speak your language or place the same importance on customer service, I'm glad it wasn't something I had to do alone. While in the program, I met my partner which led me to applying for TAPIF a second time in one of the DOMs. This gave me the opportunity to see a whole other side of French life and the country's influences abroad. It wasn't all positive nor was it easy, but I believe my understanding of life outside of America and the perspective I gained during the program did just as much if not more to shape me and my world view than all my years of education. Because of my partner, I returned to France shortly after I ended my second assistantship and have remained there since.

I am interested in helping launch a TAPIF Alumni Chapter,"I first discovered that I liked teaching as a high school student, and continued to work as a TA in college. TAPIF allowed me to refine my teaching skills, but also my language and communication skills, and to grow professionally.   The program also gave me further experience living and immersing myself in another culture and allowed me to improve on my spoken French in addition to improving my ability to teach, lesson-plan, and collaborate with other instructors. I am currently in the process of applying to graduate school, where I plan to study public health and to become a physician. My goal is to  be able to work internationally, use my French language skills, and educate people in good health practices, all of which TAPIF helped to prepare me for.   Ironically, I also needed to use the French healthcare system during my stay in France, which gave me a very interesting new perspective on healthcare systems which are very different from the U.S. model. Incidentally, I had a very good experience with the French system, and was able to amaze my students with my experience of spending hundreds of dollars for two stitches at an American emergency room after hours of waiting. Despite having to go to the emergency room for a (thankfully minor) fracture, I was able to get both personal experience in a different healthcare system and an educational opportunity for my students (plus it stimulated them to speak more in English so they could discuss the situation) out of it, so getting a stress fracture in one of the bones in my foot didn't wind up being all bad.   All in all, TAPIF was absolutely worth it, from a personal and professional development standpoint, refining my teaching skills and giving me tools to work with people with different language backgrounds, all of which will be useful for my future career in a public health field. That may be a different path than most TAPIF alumni, given that most of the ones I keep in touch with have become French or ESL teachers or have gone back to graduate school in France, but in my experience TAPIF was equally as valuable for a future clinician and public health worker and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to participate in the program.

I am interested in helping launch a TAPIF Alumni Chapter,"The TAPIF program radically altered my professional path. Before leaving for my TAPIF year, I worked as an editor for online scientific journals. I felt unsatisfied with the work and lack of interpersonal interaction. My interest to pursue a teaching assistantship stemmed from my interest in teaching and finding more meaningful work. This, paired with a restlessness thats not uncommon to those in their early twenties, made me set off for a year of teaching in Saint Quentin. Living in France was immensely transformative; I  strengthened my knowledge of French, adjusted to a new culture, and learned about the diversity of French communities. When I returned stateside, I continued teaching, which I've done for the past four years. TAPIF pushed my outside my comfort zone. While teaching has been truly satisfying, I've begun to ask more probing questions of how to best serve students and families in the US. Next fall, I start graduate school in Social Work to start addressing these concerns and paving a new path. I know if I hadn't embarked on that first adventure (participating in TAPIF), my professional career would look very different.

Living in France every day is magical - even running standard errands like going to the bank and the grocery store has some beauty to it.

Between and after the two years of the program I completed internships in Geneva at different United Nations agencies and the American embassy in Paris in order to expand my professional experience and complete my degree. I am now working full-time at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, and plan to stay at least for two years if not longer.   My TAPIF experience during my time in Montpellier directly shaped my personal and professional path - although I had already considered staying in France (or abroad more generally) longer term before doing TAPIF, my year in Montpellier motivated me and made that goal a real possibility. The improvements I made in my French language skills and the invaluable insight into French culture and administration I acquired during TAPIF gave me the confidence to apply for a Master's program where coursework was completed in French, and also to set my sights on longer-term professional projects abroad. I firmly believe that if I had not already had a year's experience abroad through TAPIF, the likelihood of success I have been lucky enough to have in my education and career would have been greatly diminished.   Even more importantly, I also had a wonderful experience in Montpellier enjoying the city due to the friends (French and other assistants) I made during my time there.

After, I taught English in Korea, which was a positive experience that I attribute to much better support and training from my program, as well as lesons learned from my mistakes and failures from TAPIF. I'm now pursuing an MA in TESOL. Personally I've learned to communicate better and to be more proactive about finding solutions.    I still love France and French, though I don't think I'd work there again.

In fact, it probably has influenced me so much that one of my teacher college buddies (another to-be French teacher who did a study abroad in France) told me, ""It's really kind of a shame, Jill.  You're totally a French person trapped in an American's body.""  :) Sooo, ya, I guess it's shaped me a bit!

It was the first time I had ever lived completely on my own, and doing that in foreign country and foreign language made me learn so much more quickly than if I had done it at home. I learned to be more tolerant of other people and ways of doing things and learned how to overcome challenges in a way I otherwise would not have. In other words, it made me grow up-- fast!
