# #FrenchEdHack Education

## Background

As key liaison and primary foreign representation of the French government, the Embassy of France serves to engage in issues of diplomacy, policy and the interests of France and its citizens within the United States. Located in Washington, the Embassy is headed by the French Ambassador who oversees its operations, including the operations of regional consulates located throughout the US. While the French Embassy maintains a number of services, the embassy’s priorities often include military coordination, cultural awareness, economic affairs, and matters regarding the communications and the press. 

## Project Overview

Endeavoring to increase focus on education and French culture, the Embassy is looking to explore ways to increase recruitment and advocacy for French immersion programs in the United States. With a recent increase in development and interest in programs that help bring French speaking individuals to educational institutions, the need has emerged to explore ways to support and promote these programs. Specifically, **the Educational Affairs Department of the Cultural Services of the Embassy is currently focused on expanding offerings of French dual language and immersion programs in public schools across the U.S. In order to expend these offerings, which currently exist in 160 schools across the country, we need a centralized way to recruit teachers.** On the program side, there is not a single resource that bridges opportunities with individuals who may be best fit to fill those roles. As a result, finding individuals to fill these roles or to build programs is tedious and time-intensive. Similarly, on the other side, this requires individuals looking for opportunities to seek out direct program contacts or look through other resources. The problem, simply put, is that it is not easy for any institution or program to find French-speaking individuals, domestically or abroad. Hackathon solutions should focus on recruiting non-native French speaking Americans or French speakers from a francophone country whom are already in the U.S. (It is beyond the scope of today to attempt to find internationals, given the numebr of State Department complications that arise.)

As with any job or applicant search system, our hope is to investigate ways to better fill the gap through insights and narrative that corresponds with a product solution. The product should usher applicants through an onboarding process that helps them explore opportunities and make recommendations based on their job preferences. The product should make exploring or looking for opportunities easy and encourage conversion for connecting with program contacts. As there is a program side to the product, it is twofold and should consider ways that program supervisors or those looking to build programs can not only easily find talent, but garner insights regarding those interested in similar programs. Consider this as a job board and applicant tracking system for French speaking individuals (on-native French speaking Americans or French speakers from a francophone country whom are already in the U.S. with work permit, residency, or citizenship) looking to join domestic immersion programs. For the Embassy, data collected should help them understand where the need and scope of programs that are developing along with the individuals seeking those roles.

## Deliverable

Every team will present a 6 minute pitch (you will be cut off!) on their findings to the judges panel at 7:30 PM. 

Presentations must include:

- An analysis (market, data, etc. as applicable) of similar programs and job placement tools, providing insights regarding effectiveness, innovation and practices with finding opportunities and recruiting applicants. 

Presentations must include also one of the following:
- Digital product consisting of UX deliverables including but not limited to wireframes, prototype, user flows
- Marketing plan and narrative with specific suggestions on collateral and use
- Data acquisition and management strategy 

Note that recommendations can take the form of recommended additional survey information the Embassy should collect for when applicable, competitive analysis, sketched or working prototypes, interactive data visualizations, and more. Your presentation should begin with topline findings, and unpack those findings based on the results of your quantitative and qualitative analysis.

## Teams

Teams are three to four people. Given the data analysis, user experience, and (potentially live) deployment component of your task, including a diversity of skillsets should be a priority. A team that has fully deployed interactive data visualization components may provide impressive analysis, but will lack recommendations for improving the experience to end users seeking additional study abroad information. Likewise, well-researched and prototyped solutions that lack data-inforced findings may lack quantitative validity.

## Resources

The Embassy has compiled a host of resources for your success, including surveys of relevant target individuals.

## Submissions

Submissions must be submitted via pull request to the submissions folder by 7:00 PM.

To submit, create a folder within the submission folder with your team name. In that folder, place your submission materials. All submissions must include the presentation materials your group is leveraging, whether this ranges from a PDF of a PPT to links (in a markdown file) to working prototypes and deployed visualization tools. (Bear in mind you cannot add files in excess of 100MB to your Github: you should save your presentation as a PDF)

If you need help with pull requests, find Joseph in advance of the 6:30 PM deadline. Please also view this resource:

## Judging

Our judging panel has two distinguished guests and some guy lucky enough to find himself on the panel:

Kona Facia Nepay is an immersion specialist from the Baltimore International Academy.

Karl Cogard is the Attaché for Education Cooperation at the French Embassy in the US.

Joseph Nelson leads Data Science instruction at General Assembly.

## Workshops

There will be one workshop today on "Webscraping" at 3:30. This workshop will be accessible even if you have no background in webscraping. The materials are available [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/getting-data).

## Communication

We will communicate via Slack.

You have been invited. The team is available at this [link](https://frenchedhack.slack.com).
